<p>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:jeff@jeffknupp.com">jeff@jeffknupp.com</a> or

<h2>I&#8217;m having trouble with X, which you posted about. Can you help?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d be happy to try. I would be nowhere without the mentoring and support of fellow
programmers/open source software projects. I&#8217;m always looking for a
chance to give back.</p>

<h2>How do you host your various ?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=ae1808f234f8e219de24842336fada09ef81d52f">Linode</a> (note, my affiliate code is in there) for about a year and couldn&#8217;t be happier. I&#8217;m running all of my  on a single Linode: Ubuntu 11.10 w/ 512MB RAM and a 200GB transfer cap (the basic plan). Their documentation is great, if you need it, and I&#8217;ve honestly never had a support ticket answered as fast as by &#8216;cciufo&#8217; (I just looked it up) on their support team. The problem was literally fixed in 3 minutes, at 1:06 AM no less. If I sound like a shill, it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;ve had nothing but good interactions with them. <a href="http://www.linode.com">Here&#8217;s a link without my affiliate code</a>.</p>
